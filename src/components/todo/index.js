// We are going to use the index.js file to pass in multiple components to our App.js file
// Why? Because since we have multiple files in the same path, we don't want to have to write many import statements at the top of our App.js file
// Instead, for each directory, we can just create a single index.js file that will grab all the individual components that are part of the given folder
