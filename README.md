## Project Description

To deepen my understanding of React, I wanted to take a basic todo app and to explain the basic patterns of React applications and why we write them in such a way. Each .js file includes detailed comments of the working code, according to my understanding of the library, and is meant to serve as a reference for me, but would likely be accessible and possibly useful to other devs as well.
